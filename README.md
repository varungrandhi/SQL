This project covers a range of SQL queries commonly used in database management. They include creating tables for authors, books, and earnings, as well as complex queries for finding authors who did not co-author with a specific author ('T Branch'), calculating average payments for authors, and identifying authors with the lowest average payments for each book. These queries showcase fundamental SQL skills for data management and analysis in relational databases.
